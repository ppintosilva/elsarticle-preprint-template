# The Elsevier article class

\paragraph{Installation} If the document class \emph{elsarticle} is not available on your computer,
you can download and install the system package \emph{texlive-publishers} (Linux) or install the
\LaTeX\ package \emph{elsarticle} using the package manager of your \TeX\ installation, which is
typically \TeX\ Live or Mik\TeX.

\paragraph{Usage} Once the package is properly installed, you can use the document class
\emph{elsarticle} to create a manuscript. Please make sure that your manuscript follows the
guidelines in the Guide for Authors of the relevant journal. It is not necessary to typeset your
manuscript in exactly the same way as an article, unless you are submitting to a camera-ready copy
(CRC) journal.

\paragraph{Functionality} The Elsevier article class is based on the standard article class and
supports almost all of the functionality of that class. In addition, it features commands and
options to format the

- document style
- baselineskip
- front matter
- keywords and MSC codes
- theorems, definitions and proofs
- lables of enumerations
- citation style and labeling.
